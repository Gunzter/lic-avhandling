abstract = "In this paper we propose a secure ownership transfer protocol for a multi-tag multi-owner RFID environment that provides individual-owner-privacy. To our knowledge, the existing schemes do not provide individual-owner-privacy and most of the existing schemes do not comply with the EPC Global Class-1 Gen-2 (C1G2) standard since the protocols use expensive hash operations or sophisticated encryption schemes that cannot be implemented on low-cost passive tags that are highly resource constrained. Our work aims to fill these gaps by proposing a protocol that provides individual-owner-privacy, based on simple XOR and 128-bit pseudo-random number generators (PRNG), operations that are easily implemented on low-cost RFID tags while meeting the necessary security requirements thus making it a viable option for large scale implementations. Our protocol also provides additional protection by hiding the pseudo-random numbers during all transmissions using a blind-factor to prevent tracking attacks."

abstract="Considering the increasing deployment of smart home IoT devices, their ownership is likely to change during their life-cycle. IoT devices, especially those used in smart home environments, contain privacy-sensitive user data, and any ownership change of such devices can result in privacy leaks. The problem arises when users are either not aware of the need to reset/reformat the device to remove any personal data, or not trained in doing it correctly as it can be unclear what data is kept where. In addition, if the ownership change is due to theft or loss, then there is no opportunity to reset. Although there has been a lot of research on security and privacy of IoT and smart home devices, to the best of our knowledge, there is no prior work specifically on automatically securing ownership changes. We present a system called for securely handling ownership change of IoT devices. combines authentication (of both users and their smartphone), profile management, data protection by encryption, and automatic inference of ownership change. For the latter, we use a simple technique that leverages the context of a device. Finally, as a proof of concept, we develop a prototype that implements inferring ownership change from changes in the WiFi SSID. The performance evaluation of the prototype shows that has minimal overhead and is compatible with the dominant IoT boards on the market.",

abstract = "RFID and Cloud computing are widely used in the IoT (Internet of Things). However, there are few research works which combine RFID ownership transfer schemes with Cloud computing. Subsequently, this paper points out the weaknesses in two protocols proposed by Xie et al. (2013) [3] and Doss et al. (2013) [9]. To solve the security issues of these protocols, we present a provably secure RFID ownership transfer protocol which achieves the security and privacy requirements for cloud-based applications. To be more specific, the communication channels among the tags, mobile readers and the cloud database are insecure. Besides, an encrypted hash table is used in the cloud database. Next, the presented protocol not only meets backward untraceability and the proposed strong forward untraceability, but also resists against replay attacks, tracing attacks, inner reader malicious impersonation attacks, tag impersonation attacks and desynchronization attacks. The comparisons of security and performance properties show that the proposed protocol has more security, higher efficiency and better scalability compared with other schemes."
