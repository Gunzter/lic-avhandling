\section{Introduction}
\label{introduction}
Internet of Things has for a few years been one of the most talked about topics in computer science and computer security. The idea to connect *things* to a network and especially the internet has appealed to a lot of different people in different industries. The term 

"The S in IoT stands for security."



When discussing protocols protocols can be divided by two lines. Protocols can be grouped by functionality, eg. Access Control, Secure Communication, Time Synchronization etc. Or by domain, e.g Industrial Control systems, Aviation or general Internet protocols. 
In this thesis we look at protocols intended for use in constrained devices. 

Protocols designed in "silos" e.g industrial control protocols are not the same as protocols for electricity grids. 
Only lately have protocols been designed for general use.
