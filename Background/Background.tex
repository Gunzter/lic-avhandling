\subsection{Wireless sensor networks}
History
Definitions

Projection of numbers
Communication

\subsubsection{Constrained devices}
Constrained devices (reference IETF)
Limited in CPU-Power, ROM and RAM memory, communication bandwidth and latency. Energy limited, because of battery power or energy harvesting.
Devices sleep to preserve battery.


\subsection{Communication protocols}
Bluetooth
Zigbee and Z-Wave
TLS and DTLS
Object security protocols
CoAP

\subsubsection{IETF IoT}
Protocols and ideas

\subsection{IoT Data analytics}
Tie in to Paper A
IoT devices send data to servers for analytics, this accumulation of data can enable new analytic results 

\subsection{IoT device life-cycle}
Production
Initial deployment
Operation
Decommissioning
Transfer of ownership
