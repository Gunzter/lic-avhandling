year = {1984},
month = {April},
abstract = {The genesis of this paper was my realization that, in a multiprocess system with synchronized clocks, the absence of a message can carry information. I was fascinated by the idea that a process could communicating zillions of bits of information by not sending messages. The practical implementation of Byzantine generals algorithms described in [46] could be viewed as an application of this idea. I used the idea as something of a gimmick to justify the paper. The basic message of this paper should have been pretty obvious: the state machine approach, introduced in [27], allows us to turn any consensus algorithm into a general method for implementing distributed systems; the Byzantine generals algorithms of [46] were fault-tolerant consensus algorithms; hence, we had fault-tolerant implementations of arbitrary distributed systems. I published the paper because I had found few computer scientists who understood this.},

In application domains such as supply chain management, RFID tagged objects are required to securely change hands several times during their life cycle. To this end, we propose a novel ownership transfer mechanism that securely transfers an RFID tagged objects in Internet of Things (IoT). An important property of the proposed approach is that the proposed ownership transfer mechanism ensures the security of both the RFID tagged objects and the object owners. We analysed the proposed object ownership transfer protocol both qualitatively and quantitatively to evaluate its effectiveness. The analysis shows that the proposed protocol is more secure and requires less computation as compared to existing similar protocols."
